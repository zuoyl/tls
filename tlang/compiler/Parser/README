TParser is used by compiler to parse source file into parse tree.
The good method is like bison or flex to generate the .h,.cpp files
which is included by compiler. however, there is no enough time for me to
implement like that.
you can use the following build method to make a test program.
> make TParserTest

if you build the tlang compiler, at first, the TParser should be build.
> make TParser
> sudo make install

The Makefile is generated by CMake, if you want to change target,
at first, edit the CMakeLists file, and then use cmake to generate Makefile.
>vim CMakeLists
>/usr/local/bin/cmake .
>make TParser
