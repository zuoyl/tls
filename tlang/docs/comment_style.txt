   /// A convenience wrapper for creating a pair from two objects.
   ///  The standard requires that the objects be passed by reference-to-const,
   ///  but LWG issue #181 says they should be passed by const value.  We follow
   ///  the LWG by default.
   ///  @param  x  The first object.
   ///  @param  y  The second object.
   ///  @return   A newly-constructed pair<> object of the appropriate type.
